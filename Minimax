Function Description

Complete the miniMaxSum function in the editor below.

#miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of  integers
Print

Print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of  of  elements.

#Input Format

A single line of five space-separated integers.

Constraints


#Output Format

Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. (The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)

#Sample Input
